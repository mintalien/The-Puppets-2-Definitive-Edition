(NOT a legal definition): Abandonware is a product, typically software, ignored by its owner and manufacturer, and for which no official support is available. 

While EA still owns the copyright for their software, abandonware downloads are not being tracked by EA, and downloading an online version (Starter Pack or another) is easier and preferable.
